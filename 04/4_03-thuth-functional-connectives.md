#4.3 "And" and  the Truth-Functional Connectives

***And is not always a propositional connective***

- **and** is not a propositional connective in "(The company) Jack and Jill, finally talked (about something they did)"
- **and** is a prop. connec. in "Jack and Jill finally talked(in the starring competition)"
- **and** is a prop. connec. and also brings additional information in "(The couple) Jack and Jill, finally talked (after weeks not speaking to each other)". It also brings the additional proposition that, they talked to each other

**Truth-Functional connective** is propositional connective that makes a new proposition whose truth or falsity depends solely on the logic value of its propositional ingredients.

If **and** is a truth-functional connective, it's called **conjunction**.
