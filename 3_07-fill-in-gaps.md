# 3.7 Fill in Gaps (Adding suppressed premises)

**Adding supressed premisses to make the argument look good.**

> For my birthday. my wife always gives me a sweater or a board game.
This box does not contain a sweater because ir rattles when I shake it.
So, this time she must have given me a board game.

Arg. without supressed premisses (1st step)
- 1 This box rattles when I shake it
- 2∴ This box doesn't contain a sweater

This argument is not valid because it's possible for the premise to be true and the conclusion false. The box can have a sweater and small rocks to rattle.

*Adding the suppressed premise* makes the argument *valid*:

- 1 This box rattles when I shake it.
- 1* A box that contains a sweater does not rattle when shaken
- 2∴ This box does not contain a sweater

###types of suppressed premises:
- 1 Factual
- 2 Moral 
- 3 Norm-Based
- 4 Linguistic
