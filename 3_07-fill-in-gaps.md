3.7 Fill in Gaps(Ading suppressed premises)

Adding supressed premisses to make the argument look good.

For my birthday. my wife always gives me a sweater or a board game.
This box does not contain a sweater because ir rattles when I shake it.
So, this time she must have given me a board game.

Arg. without supressed premisses (1st step)
1 - This box rattles when I shake it
∴ - This box doesn't contain a sweater

This argument is not valid because it's possible for the premise to be true and the conclusion false. The box can have a sweater and small rocks to rattle.

*Adding the suppressed premise* makes the argument *valid*:

1 -  This box rattles when I shake it.
1* - A box that contains a sweater does not rattle when shaken
∴ - This box does not contain a sweater
