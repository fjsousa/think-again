#7.2 - Generalizations from Samples

It's impractical to test all instances from the same class.

###Universal

- The first F is G.
- The second F is G
- The rest fo the Fs **in the sample** are G
- C: All Fs are Gs

(Premises are about the instances while the conclusion is about the whole class)


###Partial

- The first F is G.
- The second F is G
- The third F is not G
- The fourth F is G, and so on.
- C1: X% of Fs in the sample are Gs
- C2 X% of all Fs are Gs

> In order to generalize from a sample, do I need to personally observe every case within the sample?

> Answer: No
I can get data from a trusted source or combine data from several people, so I do not need to check them all personally. Still, someone needs to check each case in the sample. That is what makes that case part of the sample.

> The fact that the argument moves from the instance to the class, shows that the argument is inductive.

How strong an argument which is a generalization from sample is, dependes on statistics
