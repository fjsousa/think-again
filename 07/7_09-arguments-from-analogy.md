# 7.9 Arguments from analogy

Analogy is a comparison between two things. It points out similaryties between those two things

- P1: This painting is like others in its colors, forms, brushwork, etc.
- P2: Those other paintings were painted by Cezanne
- C: This painting was probably also painted by Cezanne

with variables:

- P1: Object A has properties P,Q,R and so on.
- P2: Objects B,C,D, and so on also have properties P,Q,R and so on.
- P3: Objects B,C,D and so so have property X
- C: Object A (probably) also has property X

A: the subject
BCD: the analogous objects
PR: the similarities
X: the target

Standards of strength:

- A: The similarities are important (ie,"the paiting is square" is not an importante similarity)
- B: there are more similarities (the type of brush that was used, the color scheme, the subject matter, etc. You don't know which similarity is the one that makes the analogy stronger)
- C: there are fewer disanalogies (ie the paiting is not exactly the same)
- D: the analogous objects are more diverse (having similarities between diverse objects makes the analogy stronger)
- E: the conclusion is weaker

Arguments from analogy and inference to the best explanation have similarities, although the latter needs to be more precise when picking which similarity explains the hypotesis
