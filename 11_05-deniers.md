# 11.5 Deniers

**Deniers:** begins with premises about a particular person who is making a point and ends with a conclusion denying the conclusion of that person's argument.

### Deniers that are good arguments

Imagine that Arthur says:

- P1 Arthur says "I am an inveterate liar, and most of the time I speak falsely, including now: therefore this very statement is false."
- C Arthur's conclusion is not true.

Another example:

- P1 In her argument, Cybil has provided lots of evidence that Susan cheated on the exam.
- P2 Though Cybil's evidence may seem compelling, in fact Cybil is an unrepentant cheater ho repeatedly tries to hide her tracks by planting evidence of cheating on innocent people.
- C Therefore, Cybil's conclusion is probably not true.

It's a denier argument because it starts with an argument about the person and ends with the conclusion that the person's conclusion is false or probably false. It's a strong deductive argument.

More examples:

> Njeri is descended from Hutus, so of course she would defend the Hutus: that doesn't mean that her defense is accurate!

It starts with a remark about the person, but it doesn't saying that the conclusion is false

> Njeri is descended from Hutus, so despite her eloquent argument in defense of the Hutus, we know that what she is arguing is false.

It's a denier because it starts with a remark about the person and ends saying that the conclusion is false.

> Njeri is descended from Hutus, so we cannot trust anything she says on matters of importance in Rwandan politics.

It starts with a remark about the person, but it's not denying the conclusion, it's saying that we should not trust what Njeri says

> Sarah Palin is a Republican, so you can never trust what she has to say about taxes or government spending.

Not a denier because it's not denying Palin's conclusion

> Barack Obama is a Democrat, so we should not pay any heed to his argument in defense of more public sector spending.

Not a denier because it's not denying Obama's conclusion

> This very argument is a denier, so of course the conclusion of this argument is false.

Not a denier because it's not beginning with a premise about a particular person

> Obama's argument against Sarah Palin's recent comment is a denier, so of course the conclusion of that argument is false.

Not a denier because it starts with a premise on Obama's comment, not on Obama himself

> Obama's argument against Sarah Palin shows he makes vicious attacks on people of modest intellectual means, so we know that the conclusion that he reached was false.

Is a denier because it starts with a comment about Obama himself, and ends saying that the conclusion is false.
