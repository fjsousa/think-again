# 11.5 Deniers

**Deniers:** begins with premises about a particular person who is making a point and ends with a conclusion denying the conclusion of that person's argument.

### Deniers that are good arguments

Imagine that Arthur says:

- P1 Arthur says "I am an inveterate liar, and most of the time I speak falsely, including now: therefore this very statement is false."
- C Arthur's conclusion is not true.

Another example:

- P1 In her argument, Cybil has provided lots of evidence that Susan cheated on the exam.
- P2 Though Cybil's evidence may seem compelling, in fact Cybil is an unrepentant cheater ho repeatedly tries to hide her tracks by planting evidence of cheating on innocent people.
- C Therefore, Cybil's conclusion is probably not true.

It's a denier argument because it starts with an argument about the person and ends with the conclusion that the person's conclusion is false or probably false. It's a strong deductive argument.
