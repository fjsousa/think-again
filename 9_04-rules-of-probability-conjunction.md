# 9.4 Rules of Probability - Conjunction

- Two events are independent if and only if the occurrence of one has no effect on the probability of the other

Pr(h1&h2) = Pr(h1) x Pr(h2)

- The conditional probability of X given Y is the percentage of case where X occurs out of the cases where Y occurs.

Pr(h1&h2) = Pr(h1) x Pr(h2|h1)
