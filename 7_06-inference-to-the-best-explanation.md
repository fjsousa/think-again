# Inference to the Best Explanation

**Most comon kind of inductive argument**: Inferences to the best explanation are based on explanations, but their goal or purpose is not to explain what was oberved but instead, to justify belief in the hypothesis that best explains what was observed.

From the first lectures:
- Justification is used to give reasons to believe in something
- Explanation assumes that the audience already believes that the conclusion is true.

- Detective stories are inferences to the best explanation(even though Sherlock claimed to be using deductive reasoning)

- Scientific reasoning (dinasaur extinction) is also a inference to the best explanation

### Explanation (Already assumes that the conclusion is true)
- 1: When **there is a leak in the roof**, water drops through the roof.
- 2: When water comes through the roof it drops onto whatever is in its way
- 3: I'm in its way
- C: Water drops onto me

### Inference to the best explanation runs in the oposite direction (it argues that the conclusion is probably true because there's no better explanation)
- 1: Water drops onto me
- 2: A leak in the roof would explain why water drops onto me
- 3: No better explanation is available
- C: **There is a leak in the roof.**
