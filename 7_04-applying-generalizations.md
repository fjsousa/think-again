# 7.4 Applying Generalizations (Statistical Sylogisms)

- P1: I almost never like horror movies
- P2: That is a horror movie
- C: I'm not going to like it

With variables:

- P1: I almost never like Fs
- P2: That is a F
- C: I'm not going to like it

another example:

- P1: Almost all professors are wearing shoes
- P2: Walter is a professor
- C: Walter is probably wearing shoes.

with variables G - predicate or **attribute class**,  F = the subject in the general premise or **reference class**

- P1: X Fs are Gs
- P2: a is F
- C: a is (probably) G

### Standards for  Applications

- Premises must be true and justified
- Percentages should be very high or very low (strength of the inductive argument varies with the percentage)
- No smaller reference class should conflict (reference class on the generalization may differ from the reference class in the premisse)
