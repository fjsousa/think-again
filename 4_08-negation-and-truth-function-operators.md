#4.8 Negation and Truth Function Operators

**Truth functional operator** depends solely on the truth value of the proposition the operator is being applied on.

The phrase

>Walter has stopped beating his dogs

can be false because:

- Walter did not stop beating his dogs
- Walter does not exist
- Walter has no dogs

So 

>Walter has not stopped beating his dogs

can be false while the original is also false.

Negating propositions is done with: **It is not the case...**.

If not has the same value, then it is acting as an operator.
