# 12.5 False Dichotomy

An argument relies upon a false dichotomy when it falsely assumes that there are only two possible situations.

Example 1

- P1 Either other nations are with us, or they are against us, in our war against terrorism.
- P2 Switzerland is not with us.
- C Switzerland is against us.

P1 is a false dichotomy because a nation can remain neutral.

Example 2

- P1 Either the government must listen in to our phone calls, or else they will be collecting our body parts after another terrorist attack.
- P2 Better to listen in to our phone calls than to collect our body parts.
- C The government must listen in to our phone calls.

P1 is a false dichotomy so the argument doesn't show that the conclusion is true, even if the conclusion is true.

A premise can be false dichotomy when the two options it raises are very are constricted to a very improbable situation.
