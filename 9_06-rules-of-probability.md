# 9.6 Rules of probability

Imagine two contraceptive methods, each with a 0.9 probability of preventing conception. What is the prob of preventing conception by using both together?

0.9 x 0.9 = .81 < 0.9 (**wrong method**)

**Right method:**

- prob of failing: 1 - 0.9 = 0.1
- prob that both fail = 0.1 x 0.1 = 0.01
- prob that they do not both fail = 1 - 0.01 = 0.99

> The probability that an event will occur at least once in a series of **independent trials **is one minus the probability that it will no occur in that series.

1 - Pr(~h)^n (n = the number of trials)
