Imagine a minimum bet of $100000 with net gain of $1M if you draw a spade. The expect finacial value is favorable financially. However, if you only have $100000 to spend or pay the rent, then it's not a good bet because there's to much too loose.

**diminishing marginal utility** Each increment decreases in value as you get more and more increments.

**Actual overall value**, or utility of an act: all of the good and bad effects that the act actually has.

**Expected overall value** or expected utility of an act: all of the good and bad effects of the act times the probability of each effect. It's impossible to figure out the Exepect overall value, although there's opinions based on **utility**.

In decisions with ignorance or uncertainty, there's no way to compute expect financial value.
