# 11.6 Fallacies of Relevance: Appeals to Authority

An appeal to authority is an argument that begins with premises about a particular person who is making a claim, and ends with a conclusion endorsing that person's claim.

It relates to Ad Hominem because it starts the same way but ends with a conclusion in favor of the person's conclusion

- P1 Takahashi has given an eloquent presentation of evidence that normalizing US relations with Cuba will result in benefit to both nations.
- P2 Takahashi's presentation was extremely eloquent and she was very well dressed.
- C we should accept Takahashi's conclusion.

Things that a person always does in giving an argument:
- 1) Implying that I am entitled to put forth claims about the issue
- 2) Implying that certain premises support a conclusion on the issue
- 3) Claiming that the conclusion is true

According to this, there's 3 kinds of appeals to authority:

- 1) **Amplifiers**: begins with premises about a particular person who is making a point, and ends with a conclusion that we should **place great weight** on the person's point.

- 2) **Supporters**: begins with premises about a particular person who is making a point, and ends with a conclusion to the effect that the person's **reasons** are especially compelling.

- 3) **Affirmers**: begins with premises about a particular person who is making a point, and ends with a conclusion **affirming** that person's point.

Theres justified and unjustified appeals to authority. 

- Justified: They provide reasons to belive
- Unjustified, they don't provide enough reasons to believe.
