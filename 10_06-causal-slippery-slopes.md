# 10.6 Causal Slippery Slopes

A causal slippery slope argument is one that exploits the vagueness of a category to argue that a particular event will lead to a calamity that is causally connected to that event by a series of steps.

- P1 If we let doctors euthanise patients under any circumstances, it is likely that we will eventually let them kill patients who are depressed or in severe pain.
- P2 If we let doctors kill patients who are depressed or in severe pain, it it likely that we will eventually let them kill patients who are a nuisance.
- P3 Doctors should not be allowed to kill patients who are a nuisance.
- C Doctors should not be allowed to euthanise patients.

In other words, the argument states that if we allow euthanasia, then that will cause a series of events that will lead doctors do kill anyone. Therefore, we should not allow euthanasia.

It's a fallacy, because if an event is likely to cause a result, and that result is likely to cause another event, it doesn't follow that the first event causes to last.

The conclusion might be true, but it doesn't give good reasons to support it's conclusion.
