# Semantic and syntactic Ambiguity

> A semantic ambiguity happens when one word means more than one thing.

Examples:

- Gandhi stoned in rally in India.
- Iraqi head seeks arms.
- Meredith is in a terrible state.

1
- P1 Gandhi stoned in rally in India.
- P2 Drug users are not qualified to lead.
- C Gandhi not qualified to lead.

2
- P1 Meredith is in a terrible state.
- P2 Meredith is in Texas.
- C Texas is a terrible state.

Superficially, the argument can be valid if you interpret "terrible state" and a terrible state in the USA for instance, and not a psychological state.

Syntactic Ambiguity


> The government asks us to save soap and waste paper.
Tuna biting.

Is the government asking us to save on or two things in the example?

> Tuna biting off Washington coast.

Fishermen should fish off Washington coast Vs the Washington coast is being bitten off by tuna.

Example
- P1 Police can't stop gambling
- P2 Anyone who can't stop gambling needs therapy
- C The police need therapy

Superficially it seems valid because if the police falls into the category of people who can't stop gambling and if anyone who can't stop gambling needs therapy, then the police need therapy. But if you interpret it has, the police can't stop those who gamble, then the argument is not valid.
