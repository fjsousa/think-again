###Adqueate clarification

"We need to stop our enemies and stand by our friends, so we must remain strong and resolute."

Clarifying the last sentence means that we need to know who are the friends and enemies the speaker is refering to, what "stop" means, and what "standing by" means.

###Breakin the premises into parts

Fiting dependent clauses in standard form:

"Nancy finished all of her homework because all she had to do was write 25 lines of poetry, and she wrote two sonnets, which have 14 lines each."

Dependant clase is *"which have 14 lines each."*

1 - all she had to do was write 25 lines of poetry
2 - she wrote two sonnets
3 - Sonnets have 14 lines each
∴ Nancy finished all of her homework
