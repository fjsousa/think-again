#3.3 Get Down to Basics

### **Excess verbiage**

- Repetition
- Road Markers
- Red Herring: a type of tangent that intends to distracting from the main line of the argument
- Examples


> When putting arguments in standard from you need to watch out for guarding terms

###A form of excess verbiage is guarding terms:

- 1 **I think Miranda** is at home *(I think is a guarding term weakening the argument and you can cross it out)*
- 2∴ We can meet her there

- 1 Miranda is at home 
- 2∴ We **can probably** meet her there (Removing we "can probably" will transform the conclusion so you can't remove it)
