#3.2 Soundness

An argument  is sound **if and only if**
- All of it's premises are true
- It's valid

Therefore, in a sound argument, the conclusion has to be true.

If a valid argument has true a conclusion, then it's sound

But a true conclusion is not necessary and sufficient for a sound argument

|Premises | Conclusion  | Valid | Not Valid|
|-------|-------|-----|------|
|True|true|**sound** | not sound|
|true |false|impossible|not sound|
|false|true|not sound | not sound|
|false|false|not sound| not sound|

**If an argument is invalid, then it's necessarily unsound.**
