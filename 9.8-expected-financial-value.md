# 9.8 Expected Financial Value

> **Decisions with Certainty**: you know the outcomes of each options rather the the probabilities of the outcomes.

Ex: Choosing between a piza or a pasta at the restaurant. You know the outcomes of both, price, taste, etc. However, there's always a risk associated because the piza might get burned, the pasta may be salty, etc. Although in some cases, you can just ignore it.

> **Decisions with Risk**: you do not know the outcomes of each options but know the probabilities of the outcomes.

**expected value:**

Ev = Pwin x net gain - Plosing x net loss

Net gain of wining = total winings - cost of playing

Example:

#### A good bet: $1 bet wins $5 net if you pick a spade

EXPv = 1/4 x 5 - 3/4 x 1 = 1/2 **favorable**

#### A good bet: $1 bet wins $10 net if you pick an ace

1/13x 10 - 12/13 x 1 = -2/13 **unfavorable**

#### A good bet: $1 bet wins $51 net if you pick an ace

1/51 x 51 - 51/52 x 1 = 0 **neutral or fair**

Decisions with Ignorance or uncertainty
