#7.3: When are generalizations strong?

Questions to ask about generalizations:

- Are the premises true?
- Are the premises unjustified? (as in, you don't have reasons to believe that they are true)
- Is the sample too small? (**The falacy of hasty generalization**)
- Is the sample large enough? (Sometimes a single instance is large enough, depends on background information)
- Is the sample biased? (Fallacy of biased sampling)
- Was the question slanted?
