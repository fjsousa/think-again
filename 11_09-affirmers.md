# 11.9 - Affirmers

**Affirmers**: begins with premises about a particular person who is making a point, and ends with a conclusion **affirming** that person's point.

An affirmative argument does not say anything about the person having a special authority on the issue, it does not state that the reasons are specially compelling, it states that they said something, so it must be true.

- P1 Warren buffet has argued that confidence in the dollar will rise, and therefore the price of gold will soon fall.
- P2 When Warren Buffet speaks, investors listen and believe.
- C Therefore, the price of gold will soon fall.

Another example:

- P1 The pope argues that masturbation is carnal misuse of one's body and that therefore it is a sin.
- C Therefore, masturbation is a sin.

> This argument will be deemed sound by those who accept Papal Infallibility.

Even if someone who believes the papal infallibility, does not understand what carnal misuse of one's body is, they still hold the conclusion as true.
