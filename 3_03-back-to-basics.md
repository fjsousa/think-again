#3.3 Get Down to Basics

###*Excess verbiage*
-Repetition
-Road Markers
-Red Herring: a type of tangent that intends to distracting from the main line of the argument
-Examples


When puting arguments in standard from you need to whatch out for guarding terms

###A form of excess verbiage is guarding terms:

**I think Miranda** is at home (I think is a guarding term weakning the argument and you can cross it out)
.We can meet her there

Miranda is at home 
.We **can probably** meet her there (Removing we "can probably" will transform the conclusion so you can't remove it)
