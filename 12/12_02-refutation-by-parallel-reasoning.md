# 12.2 Refutation by Parallel Reasoning

To refute an argument by parallel reasoning is to show that the argument's form is not valid or strong.

To find another argument with the same form and draw a parallel between the two.

- P1 If I had a higher salary, I could buy a bigger house.
- C Therefore, if everyone had a higher salary, everyone could buy a bigger house.

A parallel argument:

- P1 If one person stands up at a ball game, then she will get a better view.
- C if everyone stands up at a ball game, then everyone will get a better view.

This argument is invalid because the premise is true but the conclusion is false.

- P1 Most people who start business ignore statistics of failure.
- P2 Most people who ignore statistics of failure are stupid.
- C most people who start businesses are stupid.

Parallel argument:

- P1 Most of my friends are organisms.
- P2 Most organisms are microscopic.
- C Most of my friends are microscopic.

A not so good example:

- If guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns.
- It would be bad if only outlaw had guns.
- C Therefore, guns should not be outlawed.

A parallel argument?

- P1 If gum is outlawed, only outlaws will have gum.
- P2 It would be bad if only outlaws had gum
- C gum should not be outlawed.

The parallel argument has to clearly be a fallacy. This last example is not clearly a fallacy.
