# 12.3 Counterexamples

A counterexample is an example that runs counter to a generalization: it thereby shows that the generalization is false.

Counterexamples can be use to refute arguments that contain generalizations in either their premises or their conclusions.

Example 1

- P1 You should **always** treat others the same way that you would like to be treated.
- P2 I would not like anyone to change my diapers.
- C I should not change the baby's diapers.

The generalization is wrong because although I would like to be treated as an adult, that doesn't mean I should treat a baby as an adult.

The reason the argument doesn't succeed is because one of the premises is false.

Example 2

- P1 If it is wrong for all of us to perform a particular action, then it is wrong for any of us to perform that action.
- P2 It is wrong for all of us to try to take the last piece of bread on the table.
-C It is wrong for any of us to try to take the last piece of bread on the table.

The conclusion is actually the counter example for P1. Sometimes is ok for a person to do something, even if it's not ok for all of us to do that same thing.

Example 3
- P1 Breaking the law is almost always wrong
- P2 Double parking is breaking the law
- C double parking is almost always wrong

Arguments of the form "almost always" cannot be refuted by a counterexample.
