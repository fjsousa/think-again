#1.3 Justification 

**Persuading** is making people **believe** or **do something** that they would not otherwise believe or do. Good reasons are not a requirement

**Justification** is showing someone a reason to **believe** the conclusion, regardless if the argument persuades someone. Requires good reasons.
