# 12.6 - Attacking a Straw Man

You attack a straw man when you misunderstood the argument or hypothesis that you are attempting to refute.

Walter: The united states should not have sent in troops to depose the government of Saddam Hussein.

Ram: Oh, so you must think that the suffering that Saddam Hussein imposed upon his citizens does not matter?!

Another ex:

Ram: We should distribute condoms to teenagers around the world, in order to prevent unwanted pregnancies and all the tragic costs that result from them.

Walter: Oh, so you must want to encourage teenagers to have as mush sex as possible?!

- P1 Living in the moment involves a very restricted set of pleasures
- P2 A good life involves many pleasures outside that restricted range
- C A good life does not involve living in the moment.

The argument is not compelling because a good life can involve living in the moment and a whole lot of things.

The argument only holds if he's attacking the idea that Living in the moment has to be the only way of living. (he's attacking a straw man.)
