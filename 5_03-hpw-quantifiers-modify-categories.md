#5.03 How quantifiers modify categories

- A: All Fs are Gs
- E: No Fs are Gs
- I: Some Fs are Gs
- O: Some Fs are not Gs

A is the negation of O and vice versa. They have the inverse truth value.

E and I are the negation of each other.

The frase

> All sheep are purple; no sheep are purple.

Is not inconsistent because if there were no sheep, then "all sheep are purple" would be true and "no sheep are purple" would also be true.
