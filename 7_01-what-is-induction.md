|Deductive Standards| Inductive Standards|
|---|---|
|Valid vs. Invalid | strong vs. weak |
|Validity: all or nothing | strength: degrees|
|indefeasable: standard of validity: |standard of strength:  defeasable|

> whether an argument is strong enough, depends on what's at stake.

*Indefeasability*: Adding another premise to a valid argument doesn't make it more invalid.

*Defeasable*: Adding another permise to a strong inductive argument can make it weaker.

> inductive arguments are not suposed to be valid
