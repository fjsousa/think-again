# 11-12 Circularity and Begging the Question

**Circularity**: when the conclusion of an argument is among the premises.

- P1 This argument has a premise
- P2 This argument has a conclusion
- C This argument has a conclusion

The conclusion is in the premises. Circularity is one extreme example of a more common fallacy which is begging the question.

**Begging the question**: when you have no reason to believe all the premises of an argument that is independent of the reason that you have to believe its conclusion. It includes circularity.

Ex 1:

- P1 The pope says that he is infallible.
- P2 Whatever the Pope says is always right.
- C the Pope is infallible.

Unless we already believe that the pope is infallible, why should we believe that the pope is always right. Maybe there's another reason to believe that, but unless it appears in the argument, the arguments begs the question.

Ex 2:

- The Bible says god exists.
- Whatever the Bible says is the truth because it was writen by god.
- God exists.
