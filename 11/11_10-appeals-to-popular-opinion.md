# 11.10 Appeals to Popular Opinion

An appeal to popular opinion is an argument that begins with premises about the popularity of a particular claim, and ends with a conclusion endorsing that claim.

#### Good examples:

- P Many people think that the verb to emulate is a synonym of to imitate.
- C Therefore, at least one of the meanings of the verb 'to emulate' is the same as 'to imitate'.

It a good argument because what the word "to emulate" means, depends on what the user of that word think it means.

> In this instance, popular opinion makes it true.

- P More and more merchants regard the local currency as losing value.
- C Local currency is losing value

It's a good argument because if more merchants regard the currency is loosing value, then the local currency will actually loose value.
