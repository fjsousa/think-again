# 11.3 Silencers

**Silencers:** begins with premises about a particular person who is making a point, and ends with a conclusion that we should disregard the person's argument altogether.

### Examples of valid silencers:

Imagine that someone bursts into the court room and screams:
- P1 I saw the accused murder the victim.
- C Therefore, the accused is guilty of the crime with which she is charged.

The argument may be valid and sound. However the judge might instruct the jury to ignore the argument because it doesn't respect the court procedure. This silencer is not a fallacy because it's valid to silence the argument because it does not follow proper procedure

Another example

A person comes into the parliament and screams
- P1 This bill will throw millions of working citizens into dire poverty
- P2 Any bill that will throw millions of working citizens into dire poverty should not be passed into law.
- C This bill should not be passed into law

A silencer to this argument is based on the fact that the argument is not delivered during the proper time. The silencer is valid because of the above reason.

### Examples of silencers which are fallacies
- We shouldn't listen to that person's argument because he's a criminal
- We shouldn't listen to that person's argument because that person is just weird.
