Amplifiers that are good arguments

- P The speaker teaches a class on media and popular culture at Columbia University.
- C Therefore, we should lend great credence to the speaker's view on the issues of which he speaks.

The argument that follows
- P Marshall McLuhan is the world's most noted living expert on popular media and culture.
- C Therefore, we should lend great credence to whatever Marshall McLuhan says.

Both are good amplifier arguments but the first one must lead to a false conclusion. They are not deductively sound but they are inductively strong.
