# 11.11 Fallacies of Vacuity

A fallacy of vacuity is a fallacy that results when as argument starts by assuming what it's supposed to establish.

- **Circularity**: when the conclusion of an argument is among the premises.

- **Begging the question**: when you have no reason to believe all the premises of an argument that is independent of the reason that you have to believe its conclusion. It includes circularity.

- **Self sealing**: when a proposition or an argument is irrefutable by any possible consideration, and so does not rule out anything.
