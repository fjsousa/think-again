# 11.9 - Affirmers

**Affirmers**: begins with premises about a particular person who is making a point, and ends with a conclusion **affirming** that person's point.

An affirmative argument does not say anything about the person having a special authority on the issue, it does not state that the reasons are specially compelling, it states that they said something, so it must be true.

- P1 Warren buffet has argued that confidence in the dollar will rise, and therefore the price of gold will soon fall.
- P2 When Warren Buffet speaks, investors listen and believe.
- C Therefore, the price of gold will soon fall.

Another example:

- P1 The pope argues that masturbation is carnal misuse of one's body and that therefore it is a sin.
- C Therefore, masturbation is a sin.

> This argument will be deemed sound by those who accept Papal Infallibility.

Even if someone who believes the papal infallibility, does not understand what carnal misuse of one's body is, they still hold the conclusion as true.

More Examples
> 1) TV personality Benn Gleck has repeatedly announced that there is no scientific consensus about whether or not the temperature of the earth has been increasing over the past century. Gleck’s TV show is sponsored by a number of big oil and gas companies, as well as a number of big automobile companies. Such important companies would never be willing to sponsor a show that was not completely truthful. Therefore, we can be certain that Gleck is right is when he says that there is no scientific consensus about global warming. 


  An argument from authority is a supporter argument when it begins with a claim about a person, and concludes, based on the idea that the person’s testimony is reliable, that the testimony is to be believed. The argument in (1) is a supporter argument from authority, since it begins with the assumption that a certain claim--Gleck’s--is sponsored by automobile companies, and that such companies would not sponsor Gleck’s program if his claim were not true. The argument, therefore, claims that the support of automobile companies is a reliable indicator of whether Gleck is telling the truth. By appealing to the reliability of automobile sponsorship, the argument from (1) is a supporter argument from authority.

  The argument from (1) is not a mere affirmer argument, since it does not just affirm the truth of Gleck’s claim. It affirms Gleck’s claim based on the reliability of automobile sponsorship. The focus on the reliability of Gleck’s testimony makes the argument a supporter, rather than an affirmer.

  Nor is the argument from (1) an amplifier argument. An amplifier argument says that the person in question has either a special right to decide a matter with her testimony, or else that the person in question plays a special role in deciding the matter, which is not just a matter of being a reliable expert. The argument from (1) does not specify any such role, however, and so the argument from (1) is not an amplifier argument, either.

  Finally, the argument from (1) is an unjustified argument, since the endorsement and support of automobile companies is not a reliable indicator of whether a claim about global warming is true. Automobile companies, in other words, are not recognized experts on global warming. Since they are not experts on global warming, their endorsement of a claim about global warming is not an indicator of its truth.
