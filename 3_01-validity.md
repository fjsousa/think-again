#3.1 Validity

###Argument standards
- validity 
- soundness

###Vices in arguments

- something wrong with the premises
- something wrong with the relation between premises and conclusion

If you avoid the vices you get the corresponding virtues; validity and soundness

###*Deductive* argument 
- The conclusion follows from the premises
- a deductive argument is *valid*

##Validity: 

Ex for validity:

- 1 Mary has a child who is pregnant
- 2 Only daughters can become pregnant
- âˆ´3 Mary has at least one daughter

An argument is invalid if you can tell at least one coherent story, in which *both the premises are true, but the conclusion is false* 

Stated the other way around: *whenever its conclusion is false, at least one premise must not be true*, in order to tell a coherent story

Or even: *Every* argument with true premises and a false conclusion is *invalid*.

###what validity is not:
* a valid argument is not necessarily good

###Kynds of arguments
|	      	  |True Conclusion		|False Conclusion     |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|
|True Premises	  | Some Valid, Some not	|All Invalid          |
|A False Premise  |Some Valid, Some not		|Some Valid. Some not |

*An argument with a false premise can still be valid*
