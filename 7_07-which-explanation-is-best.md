# 7.7 Which Explanation is the Best

- Starting point: Facts and observation of what you are trying to explain

### Virtues of Inference to the Best Explanation.
- **Falsified/not Falsified**: A good explanation can't be refuting  by new facts
- **Conservative**: Hipotesis needs to be conservative, and can't conflict with establish beliefs (ie, physics)
- **Falsifiable/empty**: Has to be falsifiable, otherwise everything can be true
- Hiptotesis **not deep or shalow**: relying on a principle that is not true
- **Ad Hoc/Lacks Power**: an explanation that applies only to the circumstances in which it was invoked to explain. Ie saying that "this time is diferent"
- **Not modest/Excessive**: an explanation that comits to more facts than needed to explain the initial observation
