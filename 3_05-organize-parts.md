#3.5 Organize Parts

###Chained arguments: Each conclusion is the reason for the next argument

"That fertilizer won't help the reses bloom,
because there is already a lot of nitrogen in the soil;
so that fertilizer will push nitrogen levels too high."

  1 - there is already a lot of nitrogen in the soil
∴ 2 - that fertilizer will push nitrogen levels too high
∴ 3 - That fertilizer won't help the reses bloom

1 -> 2 -> 3
###Branching structure

When there's two premises working independently, each providing a reason solid enough for the conclusion:

"I'm not going to go to the movie with you because I don't like horror flicks, and I'm too busy."

  1 - I don't like horror flicks
∴ 2 - I'm not going to go to that movie with you

  1* I'm too busy.
∴ 2- I'm not going to go to that movie with you

1 --\
     --> 2
1*--/

###Joint structure

The premises work together to provide support for the conclusion. Neither premise alone is sufficient for the conclusion

1 + 2
_____
  |
  ∴2

###Combined structures(linear 1-2 and joint 2,3,4)

1 -> 2|
     +| -->∴4 
     3|
