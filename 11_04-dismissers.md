# 11.4 Dismissers

**Dismissers:** begins with premises about a particular person who is making a point and ends with a conclusion to the effect that the person's reasons are not good.

### Dismissers that are good arguments

Suppose that we watched an add from a coalition of fuel companies that stated that there's no reason to believe that global warming is man made.

The following dismisser is valid:

- The fossil fuel industry is eager to operate under as little environmental regulation as possible.
- Therefore, any reasons that the member of the fossil fuel industry give in support of the conclusion that climate change is a hoax are unlikely to provide strong support that conclusion

Suppose that the head of a bureaucracy states that the budget cuts will harm the service

It's valid to dismiss with the following:

- The head of a particular bureaucracy is eager to have as large an operating budget as possible under her control
- Therefore, any reasons that she gives in support of the conclusion that her department needs to maintain or grow its current budget are unlikely to provide strong support that conclusion.

This is valid because, although the reasons the head of bureaucracy may be good, its also valid to assume that he will always be eager to have as large an operating budget as possible under her control. We should always assume that the reasons this person gives are compromised, unless there's good reasons to assume otherwise.

### Dismissers that are fallacies:

- We might dismiss the reasons someone gives not because she or he has a conflict of interest, but because:
- we might not like them
- they appear somewhat European
