#1.5 Explanation

**Explaining** is giving a reason why something happened or why something is true.

When explaining something, both speaker and audience believes in the conclusion, contrary to justification.

> Persuasion does not require explanation. 
A bad argument can persuade, but it will not explain something

Kinds of Explanations:
- Causal: Why did the bridge collapse?
- Teleological: why did Joe go to the grocery store?
- Formal: Why doesn't this peg fit in the round hole?
- Material: Why is this golf club light?
