# 8.5 Positive necessary condition tests

Conditions for: X is a necessary condition of Y:

- We have not found any case where X is absent and Y is present
- We have tested a wide variety of cases, including cases where X is absent and cases where Y is present
- If there are any other features that are never absent where Y is present, then we have tested cases where those other features are present but X is absent. (competing hipothesis)
- We have tested enough cases of various kinds that are likely to include a case where X is absent and Y is present if there is any such case

Inductive argument, therefore, defeasible
