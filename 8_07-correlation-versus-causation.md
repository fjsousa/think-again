# 8.7 Correlation versus causation

#### Causal relations

If A and B are correlated, there may be 4 types of causation:
- A causes B (the driving speed causes accidents)
- B causes A (If theres a correlation between Accidents and speed, then the cause is inverse, ie, speed causes deaths)
- Some third thing (C) causes both (having yellow teeth is correlated to lung cancer, but there's a 3rd thing that causes both)
- The correlation is accidental the taller of a kid is correlated with the size of a tree

Determining what causes what
- time
- manipulation (manipulating A and B at a time)
