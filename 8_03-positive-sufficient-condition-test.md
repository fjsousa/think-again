# 8.3 Positive Sufficient Condition Test

We have good reason to believe X IS a sufficient condition of Y if all of the following conditions are met:

- We have not found any case where X is present and Y absent.
- We have tested a wide variety of cases, including cases where X is present and cases where Y is absent.
- If there are any other features that are never present where Y is absent, then we have tested cases where those features are absent but X is present.( If there are two competing hypothesis, then we have to look at cases to decide between those hypothesis)
- We have tested enough cases of various kinds that are likely to include a case where X is present and Y is absent If there is any such case. (in the example, mean checking if theres is any bullet hole or syringe marks or any other possible cause of death, in the cases where the person died)

> cases where Y is present can't rule out what's sufficient for Y

An argument that passes the positive cond. test is defeasible and not valid. Further cases may prove that the conclusion is false. The argument is inductive.
