#5.5 Syllogisms

A syllogism is an argument with 2 premises and a conclusion, where all 3 propositions are of the A, E, I or O form.

**The subject** of the conclusion is called the subject term of the syllogism and one of the premises must also contain that subject term: the premise is the minor premise.

The subject is modified by a quantifier.

**The predicate** term of the conclusion is called the predicate term of the syllogism and one of the premises must also contain the predicate term: that premise is the major premise.

The predicate is not modified by a quantifier.
