# 12.4 Reductio Ad Absurdum

Is an argument that proves that a particular hypothesis or proposition is false, because it implies an absurdity.

- P1 The best way to fight theft is to eliminate the conditions that make it possible
- P2 The use of a tangible medium of exchange (cash) is a condition that makes teft possible
- C The best way to fight theft is to eliminate tangible media of exchange.

The argument is not sound because P1 is not true. Proving that P1 is not right can be done by reducing it to the absurd conclusion that water, oxygen and all other conditions for life, are also conditions for theft.

- P If you count long enough, you will eventually run out of numbers to count.
- C counting is an activity that cannot go on forever.

The argument is valid but P is not true, so the argument isn't sound.

Examples that don't work:

- P Somethings exist even though no one is thinking of them
- C Reality exceeds the reach of the mind.
