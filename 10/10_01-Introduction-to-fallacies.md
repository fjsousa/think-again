# 10.1 - Introduction to Fallacies

A fallacy is a kind of bad argument.

But not all bad arguments are fallacies. Some arguments are bad because their premises are false. But a fallacy is an argument that is bad because its premises don't support the conclusion, whether or not the premises are true.

#### Ex:
- P: The majority of violent crime in the USA is committed by men who earns less than $30000/year
- C: Therefore, when you see a man who earns less than $30000/year, he is likely to be a violent criminal.

The argument is a fallacy because the premises don't offer a reason to believe that most things that fall into the second category, also fall in the first.
