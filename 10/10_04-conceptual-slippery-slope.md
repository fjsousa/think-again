# 10.4 Conceptual Slippery slope

A conceptual slippery slope argument is one that exploits the vagueness of a category to argue that there is no significant difference between things that belong to a category and things that do not.

- P1 A person who is 1 m in height is short
- P2 A difference of 1 mm is not a significant difference.
- P3 A person who is 2 m in height is tall.
- C There is no significant difference between being short and being tall

This is different from the argument from an heap because an argument from the heap goes from the person being short, to the person with added height also being short. This argument explores the vagueness but allows that there are two categories, but they are not significant, ex, short from tall.

This argument is a fallacy because the premises don't support the conclusion. A 1mm difference is insignificant but that does not mean that a series of insignificant, 1 mm increments are not significant.

- P1 A person who owns only one penny is poor.
- P2 A difference of 1 penny is not a significant difference.
- P3 A person who owns 10000000000 pennies is rich
- C Therefore, there is no significant difference between being poor and being rich.
