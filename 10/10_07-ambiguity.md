# 10.7 Ambiguity

**Ambiguity** is when a word has more than one acceptable interpretation

Example of words:
- Bank
- Cardinal

Examples of ambiguous sentences:
- She is an Asian historian.
- Police kill man with axe.

If an expression has two acceptable interpretations, and we switch between those two interpretations in the course of a single argument, then we can construct an argument that may seem valid, even though it isn't.

- P1 Jones, I'm told, was sentenced to nine years in the violin case.
- P2 Our criminal justice system is not supposed to sentence anyone to spend time inside a violin case.
- C Jones's sentencing was a breach of justice.

The reason this is not valid is because the way to understand P1 and P2 is different and therefore, the conclusion does not follow from the premises.

- P1 Amelia Bedelia was told to dress the chicken for dinner.
- P2 Amelia Bedelia could not find dinner attire small enough to fit the chicken.
- C Therefore, Amelia Bedelia was not able to do as she was told.
