# 10.2 Argument from the Heap

- P1 A person who owns only one penny is poor.
- P2 A person who owns only one penny more than a poor person is also poor.
- C Therefore, a person who owns 100000000000 pennies is poor.

#### The principal of mathematical induction

All arguments in this form are true:

- P1 The number 0 belongs to some category F.
- P2 If x belongs to F, then x + 1 belongs to F.
- C All natural numbers belong to F.

**paradox:** A paradox is an argument in which all of the premises seem to be obviously true, the argument seems to be obviously valid, and yet the conclusion seems to be obviously fake.

Some paradoxes are fallacies because, despite appearances, the argument is not valid.

This type of arguments because it does not follow that a person with added insignificant increments from a certain quantity, still belongs to the same category, ie, being poor
