# 10.5 Fairness Slippery Slopes

A fairness slippery slope argument is one that exploits the vagueness of a category to argue that it is unfair to treat cases that fall into a category differently from cases that do not fall into that category.

- P1 A person who scores 100 % on the exam passes.
- P2 A difference of 0.01% is not a significant difference.
- C It is not fair to fail someone who scores a 10% on the exam

From P2, a person that scores 99.99 % does not fail, and also, it's not fair to fail someone who scores 99.98%, and also someone who scores 99.97%...

It's a fallacy because it assumes that it is not fair to fail someone with a significantly inferior score. If someone has 50 %, it does not follow that someone with 45 % can pass.
