# 10.3 Vagueness

An expression is vague when there is no precise boundary between the cases to which it correctly applies and the cases to which it does not.

Ex:
- Poor
- Bald
- Tall
- Accomplished
- Famous

Why vagueness leads to paradox

If there is no precise boundary between cases of correct application and cases of incorrect application, then it will seem obviously true that a minuscule difference from a particular thing will not change whether or not we have a case of correct or incorrect application. But the problem is that a series of minuscule differences can amount to a large difference.
