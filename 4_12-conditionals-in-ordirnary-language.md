#4.12 Conditionals in Ordinary Language

>If I had been 4 ft tall, then I would have been in the Guinness Book of world records

Is not a truth func. connective

Because both propositions can be false, but the truth value of the proposition depends on how many philosophy prof. are less than 4ft tall.

##Subjunctive mode

**If** is expressing truth functional conditional sometimes as in **only if**

- If John goes, Jim stays
- Jim stays, only if John goes
